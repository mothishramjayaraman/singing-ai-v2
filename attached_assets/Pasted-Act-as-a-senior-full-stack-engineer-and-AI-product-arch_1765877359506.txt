Act as a senior full-stack engineer and AI product architect.

Build a fully runnable web application named **SingSmart AI**, a beginner-friendly singing education platform powered by generative AI concepts.

The app must run end-to-end in Replit with no paid APIs, using mock AI logic where needed, and be cleanly structured for future real AI integration.

================================
TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
================================
Frontend:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Web Audio API (mic input, playback)

Backend:
- Node.js + Express
- Simple data storage (JSON or SQLite)

Architecture:
- Clear separation: frontend / backend / services
- Mock AI services with comments showing where OpenAI Audio, Suno, or Udio APIs would plug in

================================
CORE APP FLOW
================================

### User Onboarding
- Collect: name, experience level, vocal range (optional)
- Store user profile and progress

### Learning System
Implement a **3-phase progression system** with UI navigation and locked/unlocked phases.

--------------------------------
PHASE 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–4)
--------------------------------
Features:
- Microphone voice recording
- Mock voice analysis:
  - Pitch accuracy
  - Tone stability
  - Breathing consistency
- Visual feedback (scores, meters, charts)
- AI-generated vocal warm-up exercises
- Auto-generated weekly practice routine

--------------------------------
PHASE 2: Technique & Expression (Weeks 5–8)
--------------------------------
Features:
- Song recommendation based on vocal range & style
- Mock generative backing tracks (genre-based)
- Adaptive difficulty system:
  - Adjust exercises based on previous scores

--------------------------------
PHASE 3: Performance & Confidence (Weeks 9–12)
--------------------------------
Features:
- Virtual performance simulator:
  - Simulated audience reactions (text, visuals, or sound effects)
- Mock generative performance video:
  - Visual overlays and stage effects
- Basic audio mastering:
  - Volume normalization
  - Clarity enhancement

================================
DASHBOARD & UI
================================
- Clean, modern, beginner-friendly UI
- User dashboard showing:
  - Weekly goals
  - Phase progress
  - Performance scores
  - Completed exercises
- Audio recording & playback controls
- Clear phase navigation

================================
DELIVERABLES
================================
- Fully runnable Replit project
- Complete frontend and backend code
- Mock AI services with clear extensibility
- Sample demo data
- README.md explaining:
  - How the app works
  - Folder structure
  - How to replace mock AI with real APIs

================================
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
================================
- No external paid APIs
- No broken or placeholder UI elements
- Code must be commented and readable
- Focus on real usability, not just mockups

Generate the complete project with all required files and code.
